## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Another Tetris clone

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Recreating the classic game Tetris using Unity

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be recreating Tetris using Unity. There are many different versions of Tetris so I will using the orginal as my base. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A screen that shows the shapes falling, which the player can control. When a line is filled it will disappear.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A score system and for the shapes to fall faster over time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A title screen with art and music

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This will be my first time making a game so I'm excited how the project will go. I will need to research some guides on how to operate Unity since this will be my first time using it. I'm confident I will be able to complete the project. By the end of this project I would hope to have a basic understanding of Unity.
